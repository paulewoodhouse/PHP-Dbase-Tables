# PHP-Dbase-Tables
quick and dirty PHP function to create formatted HTML tables from a database

Exactly what it says on the tin, this just creates a formatted sortable HTML table from a SQL query.
jscript for sorting the table comes from https://github.com/HubSpot/sortable/
It works with Ajax (once you work out that you have to call initialising the table sort in the correct place)
